### Prompt
- Team Network wants to target facilities that are likely to join and convert to Parachute. Given this dataset, come up with a data-driven way for Team Network to target these facilities.


### Abstract
Parachute Health should focus on three types of facilities in order to most efficiently grow their network:
1. Parachute should look at the attributes of the converted facilities and find unconverted facilities who match and target them since they are active users. In this case, the median time to conversion was 31 days with a median of 23 orders. Using these metrics we can find 28 facilities who are "super users" that should be converted to the network. 
2. Parachute should have facility agreement numbers that match actual state population distributions.  I.e. California is the highest population state with presumably the most number of potential facilities, yet its 4th in the facility population list.  Ohio is 7th by population buy 3rd in Parachute. Conversion rate by state is very consistent so that tells me there are no roadblocks like regulations, etc.. that stand in the way of conversion.  The facilities agreements list needs to match state populations in order to drive more conversions in nominal numbers.
